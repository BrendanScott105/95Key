# Initial code and output
This folder contains the initial version of this program

As well as an output file of 1 milion VALID Windows 95 & Nt 4.0 keys, yes, 1 million VALID keys, just for the fun of it knowing this is the most anywhere on the internet :) [Compressed heavily through 7zip of course]

Along with this, a more easily viewable file is provided with 1,000 valid keys as opposed to 1,000,000 keys
