# 95Key
A Windows 95 & NT 4.0 era OEM License key generator [Meaning this works for Office95 OEM installs and similar products]

Let me be clear that I do not condone piracy, but in this specific instance, it deals with outdated and unsupported software aged 25 years old, with license keys unbound to the system through a TPM chip or similar motherboard modules, and has keys provided online on numerous other sites already.
